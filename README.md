 Game allowing user to program movement of an automatic vacuum.

The gameplay is fairly straightforward, with clear instructions on how to control
the various parameters of the game. 

The game is played in the console. It is built using JDK version 17, and  should
require this update to run properly. 

The project imports scanner form the Java util library to simplify user input. It should handle all illegal user inputs, although it has not been fully tested. The limitations on user input are clearly described during execution.

This project was created as a technical test for an apprenticeship program at Yanport in Paris.
